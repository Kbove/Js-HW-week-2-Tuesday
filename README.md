# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## User Story
As a user, I know that my privacy is questionable on the internet. That's why I need a password generator that will randomly generate a password that meets specific criteria without breaking. A password generator so foolproof, even a baby could use it without breaking it, and successfully generate a random array of characters that no cyber thief could ever crack.

### Description
This password generator powered by javascript uses window prompts and confirms to collect user inputs in order to build out criteria for their randomly generated password. It'll direct you how to use it, display error messages if you try to do something to break it, and display a password given your specifications.
